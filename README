@version 2.0.1

This program using a min-maxing technique to create a guessing algorithm which will always
guess the code within 5 guesses. You can also guess the code generated by the program.

Compile:
    javac *.java

Run:
    java Driver

Rules:
    The guesser (decided by you at the start of the program) gets to start guessing the numbers
    of the 4 digit code set by the other party. Each digit is in the range of 1-6.  If the number 
    in the slot is in the correct spot, it responds with !, if the numbers in the code, but in 
    the wrong spot it responds with a ? for that slot. If the number isn't in the code at all,
    then it responds with a - for that slot. You get 12 guesses in total to get the code right.
